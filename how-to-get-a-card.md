## Get a Medical Cannabis Card  

*Step One:* Determine that you, or someone close to you, qualifies  
*Step Two:* Find a doctor to sign your recommendation  
*Step Three:* Fill out the applications  

### Step One: Qualify
* You must be an Illinois resident
* You may not have been convicted of a felony drug crime or violent crime.
* You (or someone close to you) must have a qualifying medical condition.  A complete list of these conditions is on the [Conditions Page]({{ site.github.url }}/conditions/){:target="_blank"}.

### Step Two: Doctor's recommendation
Any doctor licensed to write a prescription can sign your certification form as long as they have a relationship with you.  For example, a cancer patient's internist, or even psychiatrist, has the legal authority to sign your physician certification form.

If your current physician has concerns or refuses to sign the form, please use our [Find a Doctor]({{ site.github.url }}/doctor){:target="_blank"} page to find suitable doctor.

> **Optional Step: Assign a Caregiver**   
> We __strongly recommend that patients assign a caregiver.__  A caregiver is someone designated by a patient to help purchase cannabis on their behalf. Caregivers have all of the privileges of purchasing and possessing cannabis as a patient. 

### Step Three: Apply.
Applications can be completed with the [online web-based application](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/medical-cannabis/medical-cannabis-registry-application){:target="_blank"} form or by printing out an application from our [Forms Page]({{  site.github.url  }}/forms){:target="_blank"} and mailing or e-mailing it in to the Dept of Public Health.  In order to complete the application, you will need:  

*__Proof of Residency__*   
Two documents from among the following:  

   * Pay stub from the previous 60 days  
   * Valid voter registration card with an Illinois address  
   * Valid IL driver’s license or IL ID  
   * Notarized homeless status certification  
   * Bank statement, less than 60 days old  
   * Deed, title, mortgage, home lease agreement  
   * Homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy  
   * SSI, SSDI Statement, or recent medical claim  
   * Official mail from IL college or university  
   * Utility Bill, no less than 60 days old  

*__Proof of Identity and Age__*   
A valid ID or Driver’s License issued by Illinois, or a US government ID, such as a passport 

*__Photograph__*  
No older than 30 days old, 2” x 2”, taken against a plan background with a full-face view. The patient cannot be wearing glasses or a head covering that covers any part of the face. 

*__Fingerprints__*  
Fingerprints can be taken at any Livescan vendor. If you decide to have a Caregiver, the caregiver must be included in the application and must also have their fingerprints taken.  

### Costs
The application fee is $100 (those on need-based assistance pay $50) and the caregiver fee is $25. Fingerprints cost between $55-$65 and are required for both the patient and caregiver. 

> Many dispensaries offer fingerprinting services at reduced cost and will also assist in the application process.  Visit our [Dispensary Page]({{ site.github.url }}/find) to find the dispensary you want to register with and contact them directly for more information.

### Veterans
Veterans receiving care from a Veterans Affairs facility will need to request VA Form 10-5345 to authorize the release of your medical records, and VA Form DD214 to certify character and dates of service, rather than a physician recommendation form.

### Minors
All qualifying conditions apply to minors as well, but their applications must be completed by a parent or legal guardian. In addition to a physician signing the minor’s medical cannabis recommendation form, a second physician is required to sign a reviewing physician form for minors. 

The Parent or Guardian of a qualifying minor will have to fill out the
[Application for Minors]({{ site.github.url }}/forms){:target="_blank"}
and will also need a to acquire a second, reviewing physician’s approval.
